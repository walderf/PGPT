#### The level of censorship and actions taken by the PrivacyGuide's team shocked me. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but I could not allow these actions to go unignored. Freedom of speech and information are important. There's a truth out there and the community deserves to know what that truth is.

# Who's side are you on?

#### The truth's side. I am remaining as unbiased as I can, personally. The information will remain unbiased, unmolested, and raw. 

# How can I help?

#### If you know anything feel free to disclose it to me, /u/walderf, on reddit. 

# What are you going to do if you can't uncover the truth? 

#### Excellent question, thank you.
