# Random Observations / Notes

* quick to attack BurungHantu on their censored threads

* when censoring the post, the are claiming this was "exhaustively and comprehensively covered" 6 months ago when they split off and created their own site

* first post about BurungHantu's statement submitted to /r/privacyguides on 4-1-2022 at 18:23:18 UTC.

* PG ronically annouunces the major new site redesign not long after that on 4-1-2022 at 19:43:34 UTC. 

* PG also announces a paid bounty program for privacy-related articles about 7 hours later on 4-2-2022 at 02:39:34 UTC. 

* were these things scheduled to be released today or were they decided with haste in hopes of serving as a distraction?
